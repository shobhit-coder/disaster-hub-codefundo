# Note:
The project contains two android apps and some code deployed on VM. The code on VM is in this repository and the both Android projects couldn't be added to repository, so we are sharing them separately. Here's the links to the public repositories:

# Team Adroit - StaySafe

Most of the lives lost during any natural disaster can be avoided by making the right decisions right before the disaster strikes and by taking the necessary precautions. During any natural calamity it’s the unpreparedness and the lack of knowledge that actually cost human life. Knowing about the type of disaster is not enough. It’s the precautionary steps along with certain protocols that is the key to minimising lives lost.

## Identify Unsafe Zones through Crowdsourcing
Based on the live location of the user a notification would pop up checking if the user is safe. Users in distress will be marked unsafe. This would enable in creating safe and unsafe zones.
During a disaster, internet services are usually hit. The app also sends an automated SMS to the server under offline conditions to gather user details. Data from the server about safe and unsafe zones will also be communicated using SMS under offline conditions. 
 
## Notify Emergency Contacts
The user’s timestamped location will be sent to the emergency contacts.

## Keeping users safe with real-time notifications
Many disasters can be predicted and our app makes use of APIs to predict disasters. Disasters like earthquakes cannot be predicted, so for such situations, the app gives real-time updates about an earthquake with the help of an API.
The app makes use of various APIs to provide notifications if there is threat of a natural disaster or if a natural disaster has occurred near the user’s location. The user will be notified to take necessary steps with the help of a to-do list and a map of nearby safe zones will start getting populated.
Cyclones alerts are provided using APIs by aerisweather. Earthquake data is provided using USGS API. Users will be notified about disasters for which APIs aren’t readily available through data collected from reliable news sources.
The app also provides several customised todo lists so that the user takes the necessary precautions and also the right decisions after a calamity has struck.

## Providing Rescue Team with necessary information (Persistent Notification)
In many scenarios, the rescue team reaches the site and there are many people who are unable to move or communicate. Also, members of the rescue team may not be well versed with the local language.
To solve these problems, the app will display a persistent notification in case of a disaster on the devices of all people in the affected areas that displays information crucial to the rescue team such as name, blood group, allergies, medications and emergency contact details.

## What to do when calamity strikes?
The app is packed with the detailed and informative checklist to help you get through the disaster and prepare you for the worst.
Algorithms are run to predict the type of disaster that may be affecting the users, and appropriate to-do/checklist is forwarded to gear them up.

Therefore, stay informed about the different types of emergencies that could occur and their appropriate responses.
